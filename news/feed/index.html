										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">ZackXBT, the on-chain investigator, has yet again found something of interest. Now, he has made some serious accusations against crypto industry behemoth Lark Davis. However, Lark Davis insists that his actions were not illegal or inappropriate.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The anonymous investigator had also accused American YouTuber Logan Paul of supporting numerous “pump and dump” schemes. It was alleged that the influencer used NFT initiatives to take advantage of his audience.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">According to ZachXBT, Davis pushed low-cap projects eight times before dumping them without warning the community. He allegedly made about $1 million through this.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The first incident took place in February 2021; 62,500 UMB tokens were sent to an address associated with Davis right after its promotion. ZachXBT’s analysis claims that Davis made about $56,000 by selling the assets he promoted just hours ago. The same trend also followed in DOWS tokens. Ever since Davis has allegedly promoted and sold off a portion of the tokens he was given to promote SHOPX, BMI, PMON, XED, and APY following their launches.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">ZachXBT says that all the cryptocurrency projects that Davis backed had “awful” tokenomics, which is why most of them hit the ground before the bear market even hit.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As far as everything is done transparently, it is okay for crypto influencers to partake in seed rounds and promote enterprises they sincerely appreciate. But in Davis’s case, he abandoned his “discounted launchpad bags right after shills across YT, Twitter, and newsletter.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Davis rebutted by stating that he sold tokens at the time of their release and that behavior is typical of an “investing practice for token sales.” The crypto influencer slammed ZachXBT’s claims as “ridiculous” and nonsensical. He explained how he made money in every scenario ZachXBT highlighted, asserting that he uses the investing method he preaches.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">In a first of its kind, it was reported that Bruce Willis had sold his face to a deepfake company called Deepcake. However, these reports were denied by the actor’s spokesperson, who stated that there was “no partnership or agreement” with the company.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A Deepcake representative stated that only Willis had the right to his face. Willis retired from acting in March after he was diagnosed with aphasia, a speech impairing disorder.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Deepfakes use artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning technology to create realistic videos, largely of celebrities or politicians. This technology is a game changer for actors who can no longer act.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A deepfake of Bruce Willis was used to create an advert for Megafon, a Russian telecoms company, last year. The tech used in this advert was created by Deepcake, which is an AI company specializing in deepfakes. According to Deepcake, they had worked closely with Willis’ team on the advert. They said that he gave them his consent along with a lot of materials to make his Digital Twin. Further adding that, it has a unique library of high-resolution celebrities, influencers, and historical figures.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Deepcake promotes its work on the website with a Mr. Willis quote. However, Willis’ agent told the BBC that Bruce has no partnership or agreement with this Deepcake company.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In a statement from Deepcake, the company said reports stating that it had bought the rights to Bruce Willis’s face were not true. The company said that the statements were inaccurate. Bruce cannot sell anyone these rights; they are his by default.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The whole confusion shows just how new the technology is and also the lack of clear rules around it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">AI replacement is a growing trend. Some are concerned that AI deep fakes will take away work from actors or that they would lose control over their faces and voices.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">On Friday, Russian President Vladimir Putin will announce the annexation of four areas of Ukraine in a ceremony that Ukraine has dubbed a &#8220;Kremlin freak show.&#8221; This will escalate his seven-month war and usher it into an unforeseeable new phase.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Three days after hurriedly held elections, in which Moscow&#8217;s proxies in the occupied regions proclaimed majorities of up to 99% in approval of joining Russia, A declaration on &#8220;the admission of new areas into the Russian Federation&#8221; would be signed during Putin&#8217;s watch.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">These elections were condemned as fraudulent, illegitimate, and held under duress by the governments of Ukraine and the West. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken stated on Thursday that &#8220;the Kremlin&#8217;s phony referenda are a failed effort to hide what equates to an additional attempt at a land grab in Ukraine.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">According to Moscow, people voluntarily choose to return to their &#8220;historical motherland.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The event, will commences at 3 p.m. (1200 GMT) in the columned St. George&#8217;s Hall of the Grand Kremlin Palace, where marble plaques with gold engraving honor Russian military heroes, will take place eight years after Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine after an invasion and a similar vote.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The takeover of the areas of Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson occurs at a difficult time for Putin despite the triumphant setting.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ukraine took the lead this month by defeating Russian forces in the northeastern Kharkiv region after months of grueling, attritional combat. The unpopular partial mobilization that Putin announced last week forced thousands of men of combat age to leave the nation. The chaotic nature of the call-up has drawn criticism from even ardent Kremlin loyalists, and on Thursday, Putin himself stated that &#8220;all faults must be addressed.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Nuclear hazard<br />
Russia has the majority of Donetsk and Zaporizhzhia, where the battle has been raging close to Europe&#8217;s largest nuclear facility, but only around 60% of Donetsk and 70% of Kherson.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Front lines will now pass through territory that Russia is claiming as its own because of the hasty annexations, and Putin has stated that he is prepared to defend it with nuclear weapons if necessary.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Some Western politicians referred to that as a bluff, which Putin categorically refuted. Nevertheless, according to the US, Washington has warned Russia of dire repercussions should it ever use a nuclear bomb.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">According to Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak, the Kremlin event was a &#8220;freak show&#8221; and had no legal significance. He wrote on Twitter that nonexistent entities couldn&#8217;t enter a nation that was falling apart.<br />
If Moscow went forward, it would have &#8220;no legal value and deserves to be denounced,&#8221; according to United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In Kherson, Kirill Stremousov, a Russian-installed official, posted a video of himself in front of Red Square with the following declaration: &#8220;Our team has won. We are Russia.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">According to the Kremlin, Putin may not attend a celebratory concert scheduled for Friday night on the square. For the annexation process to be approved on or before October 7, when he turns 70, he is expected to address parliament separately later.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Following a cyberattack on Optus, the second-largest telco in the nation, Australian authorities announced on Friday that they had started an effort to protect the personal details of 10,000 people whose information may have been shared online.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">These actions occurred three days after an anonymous person claimed online that they had disclosed the personal information of 10,000 Optus customers and would continue to do so every day until they earned $1 million.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Australian Federal Police&#8217;s (AFP) assistant commissioner for cyber command, Justine Gough, stated that the organization was attempting to locate and safeguard the same number of individuals whose &#8220;information had been unlawfully exposed.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The targeted effort, which is in addition to a global investigation to find the hacker, is the police&#8217;s most overt admission yet that there is a threat to the public. However, Gough would comment explicitly on the ransom message.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Authorities have neglected to comment on their investigation since Singapore Telecommunications-owned telecom initially reported the theft of the information of up to 10 million users on Sept. 22. This number is 40% of Australia&#8217;s population.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The 100-point identification of those 10,000 persons may have been compromised, according to Gough.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Australian legislation assigns point scores to the experts that can be used for personal identification to pass sensitive transactions, which normally require at least 100 identification points.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">According to Optus, the stolen data contained driver&#8217;s licenses and passport numbers worth 40 and 70 points, respectively.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Police, according to Gough, were doing data analyses to identify the 10,000 consumers, keeping an eye out for indicators that thieves were attempting to sell the data online, and alerting banks to any questionable activities.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While she likewise refrained from commenting on the ransom post, which was quickly removed, Gough stated that numerous leads were being pursued by law enforcement agencies worldwide, including the U.S. FBI.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;Whoever is responsible for this attack has used cryptographic algorithms,&#8221; she continued.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The expense of restoring clients&#8217; compromised passports had been publicly demanded by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, and Optus had complied, he said on Friday.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Albanese claims that Optus has responded to his request. &#8220;They&#8217;ll cover the price of replacing affected customers&#8217; passports. I think that&#8217;s extremely appropriate.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Some state governments in Australia have declared they will replace compromised Optus subscribers&#8217; driver&#8217;s licenses.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">An email request for feedback from Optus did not receive a prompt response.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">An investigation exposed a fake car dealership called Auto-Promotions that defrauded victims out of thousands of pounds. The rise in fraud cases has led to consumers being warned to beware of scams before buying second-hand cars online.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Almost 3,000 cases of online vehicle fraud were reported in 2021, a 21% rise from 2019. Consumer groups have also warned the scam could be reported as people are increasingly moving to the internet for a bargain online.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Pietro Pagliuca, West Yorkshire, transferred about £4,000 to Auto-Promotions for a second-hand Nissan Qashqai. Auto-Promotions was a legitimate car dealership that was imitated to appear legitimate. The family company has nothing to do with the fake website being investigated but is still listed on Companies House– the government agency that records businesses’ details.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Pietro decided to transfer the cash after a phone chat with an apparent “sales director.” He trusted the company due to what he thought was a company stamp on the invoice he received. He got half of the money back after he reported the online transaction to his bank.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Auto-Promotions website was active from March to early September, when it was forced shut by police following the investigation. It advertised hundreds of second-hand vehicles at attractive prices. The car details were probably taken from legitimate online websites where they were priced more.</p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;">How to avoid fraud when buying cars online:</h5>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>Do not transfer money online.</li>
<li>Use safer options like credit card or PayPal.</li>
<li>Research the dealership prior to sending any money, like the registration number.</li>
<li>Ensure that the documents are available.</li>
<li>Buy from an approved dealer, and stick to a local dealer if possible.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">National Trading Standards passed the website as legitimate due to the extent of detail involved. The fake website included professional headshots of “staff”&#8212; people who had no idea their photos were being used.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">England, Wales, and Northern Ireland reported 2,969 reports of online vehicle fraud in 2021, up by 21% from 2,459 in 2019. Consumers were duped by about £9.5m last year owing to these scams.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">According to National Trading Standards, consumers looking for a bargain due to the cost of living crisis, added to the new car supply problems, presented a demand that criminals readily exploit.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Mike Andrews, eCrime head, said this scam was the first to have conducted a con of this scale. An odd car for sale on platforms is usual, but setting up an entire website to defraud consumers is very peculiar, he said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The consumers defrauded are not the only victims.<br />
Harry Cairney, the owner of Fife garage, whose address was falsely listed on Auto-Promotions, received hundreds of calls in recent months asking about the vehicles advertised on the website. He was also confronted by angry customers; he then put up an alert on his garage’s Facebook page about the scam.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But the closure of the website does not necessarily mean the end of the fraud; the criminals often quickly set up another website in a matter of days. So, make sure to do thorough research before trusting someone with your money.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The operations of US cyberattacks and abroad surveillance continued for over a decade since whistleblower Edward Snowden’s crackdown on the US government’s extensive surveillance infrastructure that spied on Americans. The government has violated the privacy of its citizens and the security, dignity, and interests of other sovereign countries; this revelation gave a heavy blow to the US government’s self-proclaimed image of democracy, freedom, and defense of human rights. Additionally, Washington is nowhere near stopping its worldwide hacking and spying efforts.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Northwestern Polytechnical University (NPU) in China said in June that its systems had been a target of hackers from outside of China. In the meantime, researchers found evidence linking the hack to the US NSA’s Office of Tailored Access Operations (TAO), which collects data on cyber-warfare operations.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The US has for long used its superior cyber ability to assault other nations while disregarding the fundamental values of a civilized society to maintain order, all the while inflicting other countries.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Snowden has defended cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin. He was also involved in the development of Zcash, a privacy coin.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Some of the biggest companies on Wall Street have been fined a total of $1.8bn (£1.7bn) by US financial watchdogs as staff talked about deals and trades on their personal devices and apps.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">According to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the investigation brought to the fore “pervasive off-channel communications.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Barclays, UBS, and Goldman Sachs are among the 16 firms listed by regulators in the sweeping industry probe. This is a landmark case for the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). While the former levied fines totaling $1.1 bn, the latter imposed $710m of penalties.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">SEC chair Gary Gensler said, “finance, ultimately, depends on trust.” He further added that the market participants have failed to honor their recordkeeping and books-and-record obligations and broke that trust.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Right from January 2018 through September 2021, bank workers kept communicating business matters with colleagues, clients, and other third-party advisors routinely. This communication was carried out on their personal devices, such as text messages and WhatsApp.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The firms deleted most of those chats, which violated federal rules requiring broker-dealers and other financial institutions to preserve business communication records. This did not allow regulators to ensure compliance with key rules and gather evidence in unrelated probes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The investigation has created turmoil on Wall Street; some bankers even lost their jobs. The companies were forced to levy tough new measures to stamp out unauthorized use of apps.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Japan is about to revise the currency money laundering regulation to reduce crypto money laundering instances. The world is gripped under the threat of cryptocurrency money laundering and illicit funding.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Japanese government took the decision to establish new regulations even though they are well-advanced. This is because, when it comes to virtual currencies, the Act of Prevention of Transfer of Criminal Proceeds fails to serve the purpose. To rectify this gap, the government will reassess the existing legislation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The update of the regulations will lead to cryptocurrencies being included in it. The review will also validate user data sharing across exchanges. This essentially will allow authorities to request exchanges for data on clients. This might include user data like name and address, as well as transaction details.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Japan’s decision is aimed to help them learn how cryptocurrency is being used to launder money.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All forms of digital currency, even stablecoins, will come under the purview of this law. The proposed change will be presented during the October 3 special Diet session by the authorities concerned.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If the revised law is passed, it’ll go into force in May 2023. The exchanges that are noncompliant will be issued mandatory remedial actions. However, failing to adhere to the law will lead to legal consequences.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Authorities were forced to take the sector seriously after crypto-related crimes surged in Japan. The authorities have also resolved to amp up cryptocurrency monitoring. As a result, businesses and investors are expecting stricter regulations in the future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Bill, tabled in the United Kingdom’s parliament Wednesday, aims to combat cybercrime, money laundering, and “foreign kleptocrats” and to strengthen police powers over cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Although the bill does not particularly single out cryptocurrencies, it will make it easier and quicker for law enforcement agencies like the National Crime Agency to “seize, freeze, and recover crypto assets.” This can be done by updating and strengthening the “Proceeds of Crime Act,” a law passed in 2002 against money laundering.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Graeme Biggar, Director General National Crime Agency, in a statement, said that domestic and international criminals laundered the proceeds of their crime and corruption for years by abusing UK company structures and are widely using cryptocurrencies. He further added that these reforms are long-awaited and will help the law crackdown on both.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Economic Crime Command of Britain’s Metropolitan Police (Met) raided twice and seized crypto worth hundreds of millions of dollars in the summer of 2021. The Met confiscated about $158.0 million after an extensive investigation into several instances of money laundering.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Further investigation led to an even larger seizure of $250 million, only three weeks later. The UK is usually supportive of cryptocurrency due to its potential as a revolutionary innovation. The previous British government was even more enthusiastic and also declared its intention to become a “global crypto asset technology hub” in April.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Aide Pleterski, trader and self-proclaimed “Crypto King,” 23, is being sued as he failed to repay about $35 million to investors. The Canadian trader lost $2 million worth of property to authorities, along with two McLarens, two BMWs, and a Lamborghini.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Pleterski assured clients of substantial profits by putting money into his ability to make profitable cryptocurrency and foreign exchange deals in his company, AP Private Equity Limited.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Diane Moore is one of the creditors who trusted him; she invested the $60,000 she had set aside for the higher education of her grandkids. Pleterski agreed to give her 70% of the profits he made by trading and giving her money back in full if things went south. The contract guaranteed biweekly returns of about 10-20%. Sadly, only $10,000 of the original capital is still in play.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Moore is now not sure if Pleterski ever actually traded or if he stole from investors purposefully with his investment strategy. She is one of the 29 creditors suing Pleterski for $13 million in a bankruptcy case.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another investor took legal action against the “Crypto King” in the form of a Mareva injunction, claiming a loss of $4.5 million. This puts a global freeze on all of his assets and financial accounts.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">About 140 investors provided information to help the investigation.</p>
