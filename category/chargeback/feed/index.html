<p> </p>
<p>HubbleBIT is an online trading platform that claims to offer the earning of passive income. But, the truth is, HubbleBIT is one of the potential tricks. If you do not want to lose your investment, it is better to keep your money away from this broker. HubbleBIT is a Trading Platform. It’s an MLM company that operates in the crypto niche. The broker doesn’t even share any information about its staff on its website. What makes the broker more suspicious is – they share stock pictures as staff members on its website. Also, they shared one video with a paid actor claiming him to be a staff member. All these things are the proof of – how fake and untrustworthy the broker is and how unsafe your investments are.</p>
<p>On the other hand, HubbleBIT can’t get their deceptions straight. In an attempt to look authorized, they arranged an FINCEN certificate for an MSB registration. Generally, offshore scammers get this certificate using the wrong information.</p>

<h2>Possible scam activities of scam broker HubbleBIT</h2>
<p>Here are some of the possible reasons why we have flagged  this broker as a scam broker in this HubbleBIT review. </p>
<ul>
<li>The broker may have made a number of false claims through its website.</li>
<li>The rules and regulations, Bonus and Withdrawal policies are not legitimate and they are made for defrauding traders.</li>
<li>The broker makes continuous calls to the traders and urge them to invest higher and higher amounts.</li>
<li>The broker promises return which are too good to be true.</li>
<li>The risk warnings may not be disclosed on their webpage or that would be hidden.</li>
<li>The broker may be located in the countries or small islands where there is no proper regulation and registering a company is very easy. Usually, these countries are haven for the scam brokers.</li>
<li>This broker provides you good chances of making profits and when you decide to withdraw your money, they will state their illegitimate rules of withdrawals and ultimately you are not able to make withdrawal.</li>
<li>Broker remains operational for some time and suddenly you are not able to contact the broker or the website seems down. The broker also changes name and website URL without any notice to existing traders.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="elementor-heading-title elementor-size-default">Is HubbleBIT Legit or a Scam?</h2>

<p>When searching for brokers to conduct your trading activities with, the first and most important step should always be to learn about their certification(s). This will tell you whether they are <strong>regulated</strong> by a central authority or if HubbleBIT is an <strong>offshore</strong> and/or <strong>unregulated entity</strong>.</p>
<p>When a broker is unregulated or regulated by an entity outside of your jurisdiction, you have limited to no legal recourse in the event that your funds are compromised. In an event of theft, complaints can only be made if that broker is licensed by the regulator in your jurisdiction. Some examples of regulatory authorities that issue brokerage licenses are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission (<a href="https://www.cysec.gov.cy/en-GB/home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CySEC</strong></a>)</li>
<li>The Financial Conduct Authority (<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>FCA</strong></a>)</li>
<li>The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (<a href="https://asic.gov.au/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>ASIC</strong></a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>If a broker is not licensed by the regulatory authority in your jurisdiction, that likely means that they are unregulated and should be avoided. Even if the brokerage is regulated, it is best to avoid it if the regulator happens to be outside your jurisdiction.</p>
