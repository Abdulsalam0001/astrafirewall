This is a landmark case for the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). While the former levied fines totaling $1.1 bn, the latter imposed $710m of penalties.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">SEC chair Gary Gensler said, \u201cfinance, ultimately, depends on trust.\u201d He further added that the market participants have failed to honor their recordkeeping and books-and-record obligations and broke that trust.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Right from January 2018 through September 2021, bank workers kept communicating business matters with colleagues, clients, and other third-party advisors routinely. This communication was carried out on their personal devices, such as text messages and WhatsApp.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The firms deleted most of those chats, which violated federal rules requiring broker-dealers and other financial institutions to preserve business communication records. This did not allow regulators to ensure compliance with key rules and gather evidence in unrelated probes.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The investigation has created turmoil on Wall Street; some bankers even lost their jobs. The companies were forced to levy tough new measures to stamp out unauthorized use of apps.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Some of the biggest companies on Wall Street have been fined a total of $1.8bn (\u00a31.7bn) by US financial watchdogs as staff talked about deals and trades on their personal devices and apps.<\/p>\n... <a href=\"https:\/\/astrafirewall.com\/news\/wall-street-companies-fined-1-8bn-over-messages\/\">continue reading<\/a>.","protected":false},"author":4,"featured_media":5085,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v17.1 -
