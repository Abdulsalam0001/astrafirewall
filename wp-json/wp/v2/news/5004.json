As a result, he could be convicted to up to five years in federal prison.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The US government captured a new criminal gang with a base in Florida last month. Esteban Cabrera Da Corte, Luis Hernandez Gonzalez, and Asdrubal Ramirez Meza, three Miami residents, could spend up to 30 years in prison for their involvement in a $4 million bank and cryptocurrency scam.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Increasing Profits with AI and Human Intelligence.<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Joshua David Nicholas, the &#8220;Head Trader&#8221; for EmpiresX, a crypto exchange that promised users &#8220;guaranteed&#8221; profits, according to a statement from the US Department of Justice (DOJ).<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">However, the exchange was a fraud that defrauded unwary investors of digital assets worth $100 million. Throughout the company, Nicholas and a few coworkers deceived customers by claiming they used AI and human intelligence to boost profits.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">EmpiresX, like other Ponzi schemes, never bothered to file any paperwork with the relevant financial authorities or take any additional security measures to ensure that the business could operate legally.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The head of the platform pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud. Given that he admitted to his crimes, his maximum sentence is five years in federal prison. However, there is currently no scheduled sentencing date because the court will consider the US Sentencing Guidelines before reaching a decision.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Users were urged to report the scam on the US Department of Justice&#8217;s website if they thought they may have been a victim. As a result, they will learn more about submitting an assessment report and receiving payment.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>According to the DOJ, Joshua David Nicholas served as EmpiresX&#8217;s &#8220;Head Trader.&#8221; The exchange was a scam where $100 million worth of digital assets were taken.
