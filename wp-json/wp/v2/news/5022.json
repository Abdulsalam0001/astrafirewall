Russian troops have been forced to retreat due to the Ukrainian army reclaiming large areas of captured land.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In his speech, Mr. Zelensky claimed that the reservoir had &#8220;essentially no military value.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">According to Mr. Vilkul, two blasts were made overnight to boost the water flow from the dam to the Inhulets river.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The onslaught in the city, which had pre-war inhabitants of more than 600,000, impacted the city&#8217;s water sources.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">According to officials, water breached the river&#8217;s banks after the dam failed and flooded some homes.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">On Thursday morning, Mr. Vilkul stated that the Inhulets River&#8217;s water levels had &#8220;much decreased&#8221; by this point. There were none, he claimed.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Regarding the alleged missile strikes, Moscow has not made any public remarks.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Russian military had previously acknowledged targeting energy-producing sites that resulted in extensive blackouts last weekend that affected millions of residents in eastern Ukraine.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">On Wednesday, Mr. Zelensky traveled to Izyum, a significant logistics hub in the Kharkiv region and a recently regained city.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">He expressed gratitude to the soldiers who took part in the counteroffensive and promised to restore the Ukrainian flag to every town and city in the nation.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">According to accounts, several Russian personnel abandoned their uniforms to blend in with the civilian population in response to the speed of the Ukrainian assault.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Russia has acknowledged that some of the towns in the Kharkiv region have been abandoned by its troops but has refrained from using the term &#8220;retreat,&#8221; saying that its troops are instead reorganizing. Even in Russia itself, this assertion was widely mocked in the West.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">War crimes charges against Russia have begun to surface as Kyiv&#8217;s forces advance into the previously seized territory.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Residents of Balakliya, a town in the Kharkiv region, told the BBC that soldiers had tortured residents at the police station during the Russian occupation. Other locals described being electrocuted while being held captive.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Russia has vehemently denied committing civilian targets.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Moscow asserted that it was now focusing on the Donbas after failing in March to take Ukraine&#8217;s cities, as well as the capital Kyiv, in the north and north-east, some of which were already held by rebels supported by Russia before the Russian invasion.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Russian officials have stated that they will continue their invasion &#8220;until all the initial goals are realized.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Although army advances have been slower, a separate Ukrainian counterattack is still ongoing in the southern Kherson region.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Oleksandr Vilkul, the municipal manager, stated that residents in some districts had been instructed to leave but stressed that the issue was under control.
