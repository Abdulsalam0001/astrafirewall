OVD-Info, a human rights group in Russia, totaled the number at more than 1,300. St. Petersburg and Moscow witnessed the largest numbers of arrests.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Many were held in Irkutsk and other Siberian cities and Yekaterinburg. Vladimir Putin&#8217;s announcement was followed by a huge number of flight bookings out of Russia. Pictures of long queues at border posts were posted on social media, and the search for &#8220;how to leave Russia&#8221; skyrocketed on Google. Putin ordered a partial mobilization\u2013 300,000 military reservists (not conscripts) will be drafted to support Russian forces who have recently suffered battlefield reverses in Ukraine.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The move was followed by the Ukrainian announcement of snap referendums on joining Russia.<br \/>\nMr. Putin also stressed that he would use all available means to protect Russia, implying the use of nuclear weapons. These remarks were condemned by Ukraine and its allies.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Tough Warnings<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Disputes broke out in Moscow as protesters were being arrested. The prosecutor&#8217;s office of Moscow issued a warning that calls on the internet to join unauthorized street protests or participation in such protests could lead to up to 15 years in jail.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">They could be booked under laws against discrediting the armed forces, spreading &#8220;fake news&#8221; related to the nation&#8217;s military operation in Ukraine, or encouraging minors to protest. The tough penalties of Russia for spreading &#8220;disinformation&#8221; have reduced public anti-war protests. Vesna, the anti-war opposition group, called for widespread protests, and it reported many arrests across Russia on Telegram. A Yekaterinburg video clip shows police violently stuffing protesters into a bus.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The action is called &#8220;no to mogilisation&#8221; by Vesna\u2013 since &#8220;mogila&#8221; is Russian for a grave.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">All this while, flights to popular destinations like Instanbul in Turkey and Yerevan in Armenia were booked, with the remaining seats reaching sky-high prices. Flights from Moscow to Istanbul or Dubai were priced as high as 9,200 euros for a one-way economy class after Mr. Putin&#8217;s announcement.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The mobilization move of the Kremlin follows heavy losses in Ukraine, with Kyiv&#8217;s forces recapturing a huge area east of Kharkiv.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Putin, in his control of state media, has ensured that most of the Russians support his claim that Ukraine&#8217;s &#8220;neo-Nazi&#8221; government and Nato are a threat to Russia and that ethnic Russians have to be defended. The reality is that Ukraine&#8217;s government was democratically elected, and there are no far-right politicians. Since media restrictions are so strict, the scale of Russia&#8217;s opposition to the Kremlin line on Ukraine is not easy to gauge.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The pro-Putin regional governors in Russia, who are now organizing the mobilization, voiced support for it.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Hundreds of protesters have been arrested for rallying against the Kremlin&#8217;s decision to bring in thousands of extra troops in the war against Ukraine.
