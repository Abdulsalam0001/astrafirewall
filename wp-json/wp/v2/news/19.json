The scammers&#8217; primary victims are the investors arriving from developed countries like the UK and the USA for binary options frauds. <a href=\"https:\/\/financialfundrecovery.com\/news\/financial-conduct-authority\/\">Binary<\/a> Trading, a sort of fixed-odd betting where the net returns might be a considerable amount of profit or nothing at all. Familiar with the binary codes that a computer utilizes to run. Either it&#8217;s a one or zero. Here one indicates a profit, whereas zero implies nothing.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As of 3rd January 2018, binary options operate as a regulated investment methodology. While deciding a binary options trade, we recommend selecting one authorized by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). If your investment company is not licensed, you are at a high risk of losing your funds. You won&#8217;t be able to seek the assistance of the Financial Ombudsman Service or Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) if anything happens to your wealth or if you lose everything.<\/p>\n<h3>How do binary options scams operate<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It all commences with a marketing plan, like social media advertisements or banner ads, where the ads connect or engage you towards their web page. At an initial glance, the website would look highly legitimate, which oozes professionalism.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">However, you realize that it is duplicated at a second glimpse. Most of them operate offshore but claim to be from the US or UK. In such instances, the best measure is to verify their address. Often these fraudulent people manipulate the software, and you might believe that you are constantly earning profits. Within a moment, you suddenly end up with a loss and start losing all your money at once.<\/p>\n<h3>How to save &amp; protect yourself with the help of Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The most profitable way is putting your common sense into work. Never entertain requests from salespersons who assure such high returns within such a short span. It will help if you focus on those who the FCA authorizes. The customer should also see that the company isn&#8217;t a forged one by verifying their Firm Reference Number (FRN). You can also check their contact details by ringing them and asking for their license number. If the salespersons pressurize you, you need to invest immediately and say that you might miss out on a good bonus. We suggest you stay out of it. If nothing works, we recommend getting independent professional advice before making any investment.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Financial conduct authority (FCA) holds the power to verify and approve brokers and investment platforms.
