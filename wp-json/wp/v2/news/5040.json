In addition, it is becoming a daunting task to recruit corporate talent.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">An event at the Economic Club of Chicago held on Monday, McDonald\u2019s CEO stated. &#8216;The crime is ever increasing in every corner of the city.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">He further expressed that &#8220;What&#8217;s happening in Chicago is a common question&#8221; he encounters these days wherever he goes. There is a consensus that the city is in crisis, which may hurt our sense of civic pride.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">He further stated his concern as more than 400 chains are located across Chicago, and the businesses are taking massive hits.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The number of fatalities over the July Fourth weekend in Chicago exceeded those from the incident in Highland Park. &#8220;I envisioned a greater ruckus,&#8221; the mother says.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The statement continued, &#8220;Our restaurants are facing difficulties with beachcomber and violent crime.&#8221; We have drug overdoses occurring in our eateries, he claimed. In addition, we observe what is happening in society at large in our restaurants daily.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Chicago Mayor&#8217;s Office did not immediately answer requests for comment on Kempczinski&#8217;s statements.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Additionally, Starbucks (SBUX) has reported identical issues at several locations.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The coffee chain stated during the summer that it would shut down 16 shops due to safety issues in Seattle, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Washington, DC, and Portland, Oregon.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A Starbucks representative told experts at the time, &#8220;After careful deliberation, some stores in locations are forced to closed that have experienced a high volume of problematic occurrences that make it unsafe to continue to operate.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Starbucks executives agreed with Kempczinski that local and national dynamics frequently manifest themselves in their stores.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In an open letter to employees released in July, Starbucks senior vice presidents Debbie Stroud and Denise Nelsen said that employees are &#8220;seeing directly the challenges impacting the communities.&#8221; Furthermore, they are informed that these problems can occasionally occur in their stores as they operate hundreds of sites across the country.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Kempczinski also emphasized a different difficulty.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The CEO stated that the problem for McDonald&#8217;s wasn&#8217;t just retail conditions but also finding leaders for the corporate office and persuading corporate employees to come back to work.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In comparison to a few years ago, he stated, it&#8217;s harder today to persuade a promising McDonald&#8217;s executive to move to Chicago from one of their other offices. Likewise, he finds it more challenging now than before to get someone new to work for McDonald&#8217;s and come work with them in Chicago.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">And when it comes to heading back to the office, he said, one of the things that he hears from his staff [is]&#8230; &#8220;I&#8217;m not sure it&#8217;s safe to come downtown.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Since the beginning of this century, Americans have become more concerned about crime.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Several well-known corporations have left the city, including Citadel, Boeing, and Caterpillar, all of which recently announced plans to move their corporate headquarters, according to Kempczinski. In addition, he claimed that other cities and state mayors, and governors had asked McDonald&#8217;s to think about following suit.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">However, McDonald&#8217;s has remained devoted to Chicago, which served as its headquarters from 1955 to 1971, and will do so once more beginning in 2018. The business operated out of Oak Brook, a Chicago suburb, from 1971 to 2018.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">On Wednesday, McDonald&#8217;s revealed plans to relocate staff from its present innovation center in Romeoville, Illinois, to a new facility that will be opened at the company&#8217;s headquarters in Chicago.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In Chicago, where McDonald&#8217;s outlets are located, the company is finding it challenging to keep the business running as the crimes have increased.
