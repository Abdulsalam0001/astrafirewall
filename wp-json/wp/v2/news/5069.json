The accused, Alden Christopher Tan Choong Siang, was allegedly defrauding people by selling bogus tickets to Marquee, the largest nightclub in Singapore, according to the nation&#8217;s police department. In July of this year, the Marquee reopened when the Covid limitations were loosened.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">He allegedly tricked a victim into thinking he had authentic Marquee tickets. On July 29, the victim gave Tan an advance payment of S$1,020. On July 31, information regarding the con reached the police.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Tan was identified as the offender after a careful inquiry by the Commercial Affairs Department. He was captured on August 10. According to investigations, Tan committed 30 e-commerce scams totaling roughly S$8,500.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The group he used to advertise the tickets was called &#8220;SG Clubbing&#8221; on Telegram. People who frequent night clubs can buy and sell tickets there. According to reports, victims were tricked into paying upfront to enter the nightclub.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Tan may spend up to 10 years in prison and pay a fine on each count of cheating. Tan&#8217;s case has been postponed until September 8 while the inquiry is ongoing.<\/p>\n<h5 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Additional victims emerged.<\/h5>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Some group members reportedly believed there had been misconduct in their interactions with a man named &#8220;Adam.&#8221; According to reports, a user previously contacted Marquee&#8217;s manager to ask who this merchant was. The manager informed the man that the tickets were only offered for sale online on August 6 and that it was a fraud. Additionally, he was informed that there were a finite number of tickets.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In Singapore, an 18-year-old male was detained for participating in e-commerce fraud schemes totaling roughly $8,050.
