If an error is made, it needs to be fixed, he said.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">All governmental levels must be aware of their obligations, he continued.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">After Ukraine&#8217;s successful military campaign broke through Russian defenses around Kharkiv, Ukraine&#8217;s second most populous city, President Vladimir Putin issued the order last Thursday, the country&#8217;s first reservist mobilization since World War II.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The nation&#8217;s forces further penetrated the Russian proxy-controlled Donbas, causing the Kremlin&#8217;s forces to retreat rapidly and lose personnel and equipment.<br \/>\nThe government aims to recruit approximately 300,000 troops, according to Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu; however, the presidential order leaves the door open for a more extensive call-up.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The directive sparked demonstrations all over the nation, and the independent protest monitoring organization OVD-Info said on Saturday that it was conscious of detainment in 32 different locations, from St. Petersburg to Siberia. According to the report, police detained hundreds of people across Russia who opposed the mobilization and the war.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Flights sold out shortly after the order was given, and there were significant traffic jams at several border zone as people tried to evacuate.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Despite Shoigu&#8217;s assurance that only those with specific military talents or battle experience would be called up, there have been several stories of people without military service receiving draught papers.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Social media posts of arguments between reservists and military recruiters, as well as between public members, have alarmed even the most ardent pro-Kremlin people.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Following Matviyenko&#8217;s statement that she was aware of stories of males being called up who should not be eligible for the draught, Volodin&#8217;s post was published a short while later.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Such excesses must stop immediately. And I think it&#8217;s very appropriate that they&#8217;re getting a strong response from people in society, she wrote in a Telegram post.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&#8220;Make sure the execution of partial mobilization is executed out in complete and total accordance with the established conditions,&#8221; she said in a message addressed specifically to Russia&#8217;s regional governors, who she claimed had &#8220;full responsibility&#8221; for carrying out the call-up.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Matviyenko continued by stating that the mobilization of reservists must be done legally and &#8220;without a single error.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">On Saturday, while applicants wait to be enrolled at a military recruitment center in Volgograd, Russia, a Russian officer checks the applicants&#8217; body temperatures. AP<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Margarita Simonyan, the head of the state-run RT news station in Russia, also lamented how the mobilization was conducted on Saturday.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&#8220;They appear to purposefully incite enmity in others. Like Kyiv had sent them.&#8221; According to Simonyan&#8217;s Telegram account,<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Meanwhile, inside Ukraine, authorities claimed that until the referendums on their incorporation into Russia were over, individuals had been forbidden from leaving roughly four Russian-occupied eastern Ukrainian districts.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">On Saturday, the Kherson regional council&#8217;s deputy chairman, Yuriy Sobolevskyi, stated on his Telegram channel that &#8220;voting booths remain vacant.&#8221; However, he persisted in enforcing the voting requirement, saying, &#8220;Electoral boards are monitoring the neighborhood as armed guards maintain the area secure.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">At the United Nations on Saturday, Sergei Lavrov, Russia&#8217;s foreign minister, supported the referendums. But, according to him, if Moscow annexed an area, it would be under the &#8220;full protection&#8221; of Russia.<br \/>\nThe referendums have been rejected by Ukraine and its supporters as a ruse orchestrated by Moscow to justify escalating the conflict and launching a mobilization effort in response to recent fighting losses.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Russian or Russian-backed forces control about 15% of Ukrainian land in the four regions.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Russia would have secured a territory almost the size of Pennsylvania if it had included Crimea, which it annexed in 2014.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Speaker of the Duma, Russia&#8217;s lower house of parliament, Vyacheslav Volodin, stated in a Telegram post that &#8220;if a mistake is made, it must be fixed.&#8221;
