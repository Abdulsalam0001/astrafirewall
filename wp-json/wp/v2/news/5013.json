About 2,000 adults were polled in a survey, and one in three are so worried about clicking on the dangerous links in emails that they check them first.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The fear of scams ranked the highest among causes for this cautious approach; other major ones were identity theft and computer viruses. But it also brought to the fore the fact that 47% of these overlooked important and genuine emails, thinking they were scams.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Professor Kerensa Jennings, a senior advisor on digital impact at BT, said that online scams had been around for a number of years now. She also commissioned the research with the Good Things Foundation.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The numerous scam emails that ask people to help transfer vast sums of money, and also the recent ones that pretend to be from your bank or a well-known company demanding personal information, have made people cautious and careful. And rightly so.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It is critical that all of us are aware of the latest scams and how to protect ourselves, she said. According to her, this is important, so we don\u2019t miss out on genuine correspondence but stay safe from anything malicious.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The poll found that even after erring on the side of caution, more than one in 10 will still end up clicking on links in emails without first vetting them. As a result, three in 10 have been a victim of a scam, and nearly one in two have come close to such an ordeal by almost clicking on a link in an email that first appeared genuine.<br \/>\nOne other finding was that more than a third of those polled refuse to send their bank details over text in fear of being scammed, with nearly a fifth steering clear of social media sites for the very same reason.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">More than one in 10 will avoid shopping online to avoid data theft. Others are concerned about how safe the internet is, yet one quarter confessed the virus protection on their computer is not currently updated.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A few believe it is only a matter of time before data gets stolen. In fact, 80 percent of the surveyed agreed there should be more support for adults to develop their knowledge and confidence in online safety.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Professor Jennings further said that the main advice is to never share your personal information or bank details upfront, more so a person or company that unsolicitedly contacts you out of nowhere. Contact the organization or company directly to check the information you received if you are doubtful.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Nearly half of the adults polled overlooked important emails, thinking they were scams, according to a survey.
