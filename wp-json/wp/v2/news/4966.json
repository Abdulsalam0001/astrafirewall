According to Security experts, this would give hackers access to run any software in the name of the device&#8217;s owner while posing as the owner of the device.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Users of the impacted devices, including the iPhone 6S and later versions, the iPad models starting with the 5th generation and later, the iPad Pro models, the iPad Air 2, and Mac computers running MacOS Monterey, have been encouraged to upgrade them. In addition, certain iPod models are also affected by the bug.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">According to Apple, the reports do not specify how, where, or by whom the vulnerabilities were found. Instead, it referenced an unnamed researcher in each instance.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Commercial spyware providers, like Israel&#8217;s NSO Group, are renowned for finding and exploiting these weaknesses in software that covertly infects users&#8217; smartphones, steals personal data, and continuously monitors the targets.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The U.S. Commerce Department has banned NSO Group. The use of its malware against journalists, dissidents, and human rights campaigners is well-known across Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Latin America.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A security expert said that no technical examination of the vulnerabilities that Apple had just corrected had been published. However, according to the expert, the corporation had previously disclosed similar critical problems. In addition, it highlighted that it was aware of reports that these security weaknesses were being exploited in about a dozen different instances.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Apple revealed critical security flaws for Macs, iPads, and iPhones that could potentially let attackers seize total control of these gadgets.Recently, Apple posted two security bulletins regarding the problem; however,<\/p>\n... <a href=\"https:\/\/astrafirewall.com\/news\/apple-reveals-serious-security-flaws\/\">continue reading<\/a>.","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":4968,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v17.1 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Apple reveals serious security flaws. - Financial Fund Recovery<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Updates for Macs, iPads, and iPhones are recommended byexperts.
