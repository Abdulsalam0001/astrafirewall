The broker may operate in many countries without the regulation required by the reputed regulation authority in its country like CySec, ASIC, FCA, CNMV etc. But regulation can\u2019t be the only reason for calling this broker as a scam. Many Complaints and negative 8V reviews and other possible scam features can also be the reason. Your funds may not be safe if you are trading with this broker.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<a class=\"btn-theme\" href=\"https:\/\/astrafirewall.com\/report-a-scam\/\">\n    Report 8V.com Scam Now\n<\/a>\n<\/div>\n\n\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>8V is an online trading platform that claims to offer the earning of passive income. But, the truth is, 8V is one of the potential tricks. If you do not want to lose your investment, it is better to keep your money away from this broker. 8V is a Trading Platform. It\u2019s an MLM company that operates in the crypto niche. The broker doesn\u2019t even share any information about its staff on its website. What makes the broker more suspicious is \u2013 they share stock pictures as staff members on its website. Also, they shared one video with a paid actor claiming him to be a staff member. All these things are the proof of \u2013 how fake and untrustworthy the broker is and how unsafe your investments are.<\/p>\n<p>On the other hand, 8V.com can\u2019t get their deceptions straight. In an attempt to look authorized, they arranged an FINCEN certificate for an MSB registration. Generally, offshore scammers get this certificate using the wrong information.<\/p>\n<p>Website:\u00a0 <br \/>www.8V.com<\/p>\n<h2>Possible scam activities of scam broker 8V.com<\/h2>\n<p>Here are some of the possible reasons why we have flagged\u00a0 this broker as a scam broker in this 8V.com review.\u00a0<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The broker may have made a number of false claims through its website.<\/li>\n<li>The rules and regulations, Bonus and Withdrawal policies are not legitimate and they are made for defrauding traders.<\/li>\n<li>The broker makes continuous calls to the traders and urge them to invest higher and higher amounts.<\/li>\n<li>The broker promises return which are too good to be true.<\/li>\n<li>The risk warnings may not be disclosed on their webpage or that would be hidden.<\/li>\n<li>The broker may be located in the countries or small islands where there is no proper regulation and registering a company is very easy. Usually, these countries are haven for the scam brokers.<\/li>\n<li>This broker provides you good chances of making profits and when you decide to withdraw your money, they will state their illegitimate rules of withdrawals and ultimately you are not able to make withdrawal.<\/li>\n<li>Broker remains operational for some time and suddenly you are not able to contact the broker or the website seems down. The broker also changes name and website URL without any notice to existing traders.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Is 8V.com a scam?<\/h3>\n<p><strong>Despite what any 8V.com review has told you, 8V.com is a suspected scam<\/strong>. We don\u2019t recommend trading with them. If you are already trading with 8V.com we recommend you immediately cease depositing any amount of funds with them, in particular if they are asking for a fee to withdraw your money. DO NOT PAY IT.<\/p>\n<h2>Negative 8V.com Reviews and Complaints<\/h2>\n<p>8V.com has gotten many negative reviews and traders who traded with this broker have raised many complaints against it. Astra Firewall  has investigated a lot about this broker and based on the negative reviews, complaints and other scam features, we have listed this broker in the list of scam brokers warnings.<\/p>\n<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-1179368 elementor-widget elementor-widget-theme-post-title elementor-page-title elementor-widget-heading\" data-id=\"1179368\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"theme-post-title.default\">\n<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n<h2 class=\"elementor-heading-title elementor-size-default\">Is 8V.com Legit or a Scam?<\/h2>\n<p>Astra Firewall  does not recommend traders to trade with this broker and your funds may not be safe with this broker and 8V.com review is negative. Instead look for regulated and reputed brokers who can really help in growing your investments.\u00a0<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-62ada8d elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"62ada8d\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n<div class=\"elementor-text-editor elementor-clearfix\">\n<p>When searching for brokers to conduct your trading activities with, the first and most important step should always be to learn about their certification(s). This will tell you whether they are\u00a0<strong>regulated<\/strong> by a central authority or if 8V.com is an <strong>offshore<\/strong>\u00a0and\/or\u00a0<strong>unregulated entity<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>When a broker is unregulated or regulated by an entity outside of your jurisdiction, you have limited to no legal recourse in the event that your funds are compromised. In an event of theft, complaints can only be made if that broker is licensed by the regulator in your jurisdiction. Some examples of regulatory authorities that issue brokerage licenses are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.cysec.gov.cy\/en-GB\/home\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>CySEC<\/strong><\/a>)<\/li>\n<li>The Financial Conduct Authority (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.fca.org.uk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>FCA<\/strong><\/a>)<\/li>\n<li>The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (<a href=\"https:\/\/asic.gov.au\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>ASIC<\/strong><\/a>)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If a broker is not licensed by the regulatory authority in your jurisdiction, that likely means that they are unregulated and should be avoided. Even if the brokerage is regulated, it is best to avoid it if the regulator happens to be outside your jurisdiction.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-222ac6c elementor-widget elementor-widget-theme-post-title elementor-page-title elementor-widget-heading\" data-id=\"222ac6c\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"theme-post-title.default\">\n<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n<h2 class=\"elementor-heading-title elementor-size-default\">Got Scammed by 8V.com?<\/h2>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-dd755fa elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"dd755fa\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n<div class=\"elementor-text-editor elementor-clearfix\">\n<p>If you have lost money with 8V.com, <strong>don\u2019t panic<\/strong>.
